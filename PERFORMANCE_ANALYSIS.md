## Scalability Analysis

### Theoretical Performance Projections

#### Job Processing Capacity
Based on algorithm complexity and system design:
```
Single Worker Node:
- Concurrent Jobs: 5-10 jobs
- Processing Rate: 100-200 jobs/hour
- Memory Usage: 50-100MB per worker

System-wide (6 Worker Nodes):
- Total Concurrent: 30-60 jobs
- Daily Throughput: 2,000-3,000 jobs/day
- Weekly Capacity: 15,000-20,000 jobs/week
```

#### Horizontal Scaling Projections
| Worker Nodes | Concurrent Jobs | Daily Throughput | Memory Usage |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|--------------|
| 6 nodes | 30-60 jobs | 2,000-3,000 jobs | 300-600MB |
| 12 nodes | 60-120 jobs | 4,000-6,000 jobs | 600MB-1.2GB |
| 24 nodes | 120-240 jobs | 8,000-12,000 jobs | 1.2-2.4GB |
| 50 nodes | 250-500 jobs | 15,000-25,000 jobs | 2.5-5GB |

#### Performance Bottlenecks
1. **Database Connections**: Primary bottleneck at scale
2. **Memory Usage**: Secondary concern for large job queues
3. **Network I/O**: Tertiary bottleneck for distributed operations
4. **CPU Usage**: Minimal impact due to efficient algorithms
